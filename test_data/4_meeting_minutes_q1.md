## 1. Agenda Overview
The primary goal of this meeting was to align on the Q1 Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), review the Q4 2023 performance, and address critical blockers in the supply chain for our new hardware line.

## 2. Q4 2023 Performance Review

### 2.1 Financial Highlights
*   **Revenue:** Q4 revenue hit **$12.5M**, exceeding projections by 8%. This was largely driven by the holiday surge in subscription gift cards.
*   **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Decreased from $45 to $38 due to the viral success of the "Mindful Moments" TikTok campaign.
*   **Churn:** Monthly churn remains steady at 4.2%, but we saw a spike in churn among users on the "Legacy Basic" plan.

### 2.2 Product Milestones
*   Launched the "Sleep Stories for Kids" feature, which has seen 50k active users in the first month.
*   Successfully migrated 80% of our backend to Kubernetes, reducing server costs by 15%.

**Discussion:**
> *David (CTO):* "While the migration saved money, we are seeing some latency issues in the Asia-Pacific region. We need to look into multi-region replication in Q1."
> *Maria (Marketing):* "The churn on Legacy Basic is expected. We stopped promoting it 6 months ago. I propose we run a campaign to migrate them to Premium with a 20% discount."

**Action Items:**
*   [ ] **David:** Audit APAC latency and propose a CDN solution by Jan 30.
*   [ ] **Maria:** Draft email campaign for Legacy Basic migration by Feb 5.

## 3. Q1 2024 OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

The team finalized the following objectives for the upcoming quarter.

### Objective 1: Dominate the B2B Wellness Market
*   **KR 1:** Sign 5 deals with Fortune 500 companies.
*   **KR 2:** Launch the "Aura for Teams" admin dashboard.
*   **KR 3:** Achieve $1M in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) from B2B alone.

*James (Sales):* "We have a strong pipeline. Google and Salesforce are already piloting the beta. The blocker is the SSO (Single-Sign-On) integration; IT departments won't sign without it."
*David (CTO):* "SSO is scheduled for Sprint 4. We can prioritize it to Sprint 2 if we pause the 'Social Sharing' feature."
*Decision:* **Agreed.** SSO is now P0 priority.

### Objective 2: Enhance Personalization Engine (Project Alpha)
*   **KR 1:** Integrate Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data from Apple Watch.
*   **KR 2:** Increase "Session Completion Rate" by 15% through AI-recommended content.
*   **KR 3:** Reduce "Time to First Meditation" for new users to under 30 seconds.

### Objective 3: Maintain Operational Excellence
*   **KR 1:** Maintain 99.99% API Uptime.
*   **KR 2:** Hire 5 Senior Engineers and 2 Product Designers.
*   **KR 3:** Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 70+.

## 4. Deep Dive: Supply Chain Issues

Sarah Jenkins opened the floor to discuss the delays with the "Aura BioBand" (our upcoming hardware wearable).

*   **Issue:** The chip shortage is impacting our supplier in Taiwan. Lead times have extended from 4 weeks to 12 weeks.
*   **Impact:** We risk missing the projected Q3 launch date if we don't secure inventory now.
*   **Proposal:** Pre-order 50,000 units instead of the planned 10,000 to lock in the supply. This requires an upfront capital of $2M.

**Debate:**
> *Maria:* "If we launch late, we miss the Christmas window. That's catastrophic."
> *David:* "Do we have the cash flow?"
> *Sarah:* "Yes, but it will eat into our marketing budget for Q2."

**Decision:**
The team voted unanimously to proceed with the bulk pre-order to secure the timeline. Marketing budget will be reviewed in March to see if adjustments are needed.

**Action Items:**
*   [ ] **Sarah:** Sign the PO for 50k chips by Friday.
*   [ ] **David:** Update the hardware firmware roadmap to align with the new timeline.
