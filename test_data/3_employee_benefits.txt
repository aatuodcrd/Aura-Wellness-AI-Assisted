## 3. Work-Life Balance and Leave

### 3.1 Paid Time Off (PTO)

*   **Minimum Requirement:** We actively encourage everyone to take at least 10 days off per year to recharge.

### 3.2 Sick Leave

### 3.5 Holidays
Aura Wellness observes 12 public holidays annually. In addition, the office is closed for a "Winter Recharge" week between Christmas and New Year's Day (this does not deduct from your PTO).
